Operation Husky

1. Description:

A 4v4 map with crazy amounts of resources, and hidden goodies. This map is designed for multiplayer or singleplayer. The goal of this map is to try and recreate the operation husky battle. I tried my hardest to make it so both sides will be able to build up a big army as fast as the game will let them. I wanted to try to capture the feel storming the beach and trying to get inland. This is the first draft of this map, so I would love some feed back to make the final version perfect. Enjoy Have fun!

2. Instructions:

	-Unzip all the files in into "C:\Program Files\THQ\Company of Heroes\WWII\Data\Scenarios\mp\" 
(if you don't already have a "mp" folder in your "...\WWII\Data\Scenarios\" folder, make one!)

	-Create a shortcut to "Company of Heroes.exe" if you don't have one.
	
	-Right-click on the "Company of Heroes.exe" shortcut and add " -dev" to the end of the target.
	
	*original*
"C:\Program Files\THQ\Company of Heroes\RelicCOH.exe"

	*edited*
"C:\Program Files\THQ\Company of Heroes\RelicCOH.exe" -dev

(make sure you have a space before the -dev and that it is not in the quotation marks)
